I am a PhD student on the [INCEpTION project](https://inception-project.github.io/) where I am working on interactive annotation for NLP. Currently I research how several annotation tasks, e.g. creating corpora with linked entities or predicate-argument structures can be supported by interactive machine learning. In my free time, I love to learn Mandarin.
