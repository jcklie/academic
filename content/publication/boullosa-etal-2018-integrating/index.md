abstract: Annotating entity mentions and linking them to a knowledge resource are
  essential tasks in many domains. It disambiguates mentions, introduces cross-document
  coreferences, and the resources contribute extra information, e.g. taxonomic relations.
  Such tasks benefit from text annotation tools that integrate a search which covers
  the text, the annotations, as well as the knowledge resource. However, to the best
  of our knowledge, no current tools integrate knowledge-supported search as well
  as entity linking support. We address this gap by introducing knowledge-supported
  search functionality into the INCEpTION text annotation platform. In our approach,
  cross-document references are created by linking entity mentions to a knowledge
  base in the form of a structured hierarchical vocabulary. The resulting annotations
  are then indexed to enable fast and yet complex queries taking into account the
  text, the annotations, and the vocabulary structure.
