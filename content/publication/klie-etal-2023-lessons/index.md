abstract: Many Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems use annotated corpora for
  training and evaluation. However, labeled data is often costly to obtain and scaling
  annotation projects is difficult, which is why annotation tasks are often outsourced
  to paid crowdworkers. Citizen Science is an alternative to crowdsourcing that is
  relatively unexplored in the context of NLP. To investigate whether and how well
  Citizen Science can be applied in this setting, we conduct an exploratory study
  into engaging different groups of volunteers in Citizen Science for NLP by re-annotating
  parts of a pre-existing crowdsourced dataset. Our results show that this can yield
  high-quality annotations and at- tract motivated volunteers, but also requires considering
  factors such as scalability, participation over time, and legal and ethical issues.
  We summarize lessons learned in the form of guidelines and provide our code and
  data to aid future work on Citizen Science.
