abstract: We introduce INCEpTION, a new annotation platform for tasks including interactive
  and semantic annotation (e.g., concept linking, fact linking, knowledge base population,
  semantic frame annotation). These tasks are very time consuming and demanding for
  annotators, especially when knowledge bases are used. We address these issues by
  developing an annotation platform that incorporates machine learning capabilities
  which actively assist and guide annotators. The platform is both generic and modular.
  It targets a range of research domains in need of semantic annotation, such as digital
  humanities, bioinformatics, or linguistics. INCEpTION is publicly available as open-source
  software.
