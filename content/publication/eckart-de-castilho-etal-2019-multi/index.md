abstract: This paper describes an ecosystem consisting of three independent text annotation
  platforms. To demonstrate their ability to work in concert, we illustrate how to
  use them to address an interactive domain adaptation task in biomedical entity recognition.
  The platforms and the approach are in general domain-independent and can be readily
  applied to other areas of science.
