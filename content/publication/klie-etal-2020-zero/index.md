abstract: 'Entity linking (EL) is concerned with disambiguating entity mentions in
  a text against knowledge bases (KB). It is crucial in a considerable number of fields
  like humanities, technical writing and biomedical sciences to enrich texts with
  semantics and discover more knowledge. The use of EL in such domains requires handling
  noisy texts, low resource settings and domain-specific KBs. Existing approaches
  are mostly inappropriate for this, as they depend on training data. However, in
  the above scenario, there exists hardly annotated data, and it needs to be created
  from scratch. We therefore present a novel domain-agnostic Human-In-The-Loop annotation
  approach: we use recommenders that suggest potential concepts and adaptive candidate
  ranking, thereby speeding up the overall annotation process and making it less tedious
  for users. We evaluate our ranking approach in a simulation on difficult texts and
  show that it greatly outperforms a strong baseline in ranking accuracy. In a user
  study, the annotation speed improves by 35% compared to annotating without interactive
  support; users report that they strongly prefer our system. An open-source and ready-to-use
  implementation based on the text annotation platform INCEpTION (https://inception-project.github.io)
  is made available.'
